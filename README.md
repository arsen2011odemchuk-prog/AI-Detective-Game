# 🕵️ AI Detective Game

An AI-powered detective game built in **Python**, where players solve a mystery by **interrogating AI-controlled characters**.  
NPCs have personalities, memory, and secrets — and their answers change based on the clues you discover.

This project was created as a **Hack Club Campfire flagship project**, focused on learning new technologies and building something original from scratch.

## 🧠 What This Project Is

In this game, you play as a detective investigating a crime.  
Instead of fixed dialogue trees, you **talk freely** to characters powered by AI.

Each NPC:
- Has a defined **personality**
- Knows certain facts
- Hides secrets
- Can lie or tell the truth depending on evidence
- Remembers what you’ve already asked

The goal is to gather clues, catch contradictions, and make the **correct accusation**.

There are **multiple endings** depending on your choices.
